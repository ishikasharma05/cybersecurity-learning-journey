Completed the course of Introduction to generative AI

1. Overview
This document explains the basic idea of Generative AI and why it is important for someone starting a career in cybersecurity. It focuses on understanding the concept in a simple way, without using any specific tools.

2. What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content such as text, images, or code. It works by learning from a large amount of data and then generating similar content based on user input.

3. How Generative AI Works 
Generative AI learns patterns from data during training. When we give it a prompt, it uses what it has learned to generate a response that feels meaningful and relevant.

4. Key Things I Learned

Generative AI can create new content instead of only analyzing data
It is different from traditional AI, which mainly follows fixed rules
It responds based on the input or prompt given by the user

5. Common Uses of Generative AI

Writing content and summaries
Helping with coding and problem-solving
Supporting research and learning
Automating simple tasks

6. Why Generative AI Matters in Cybersecurity

Generative AI is important in cybersecurity because it can be used in both positive and negative ways.
Positive Side
Helps security professionals write reports faster
Assists in understanding threats and security topics
Supports security awareness and training
Negative Side
Can be used to create phishing emails
Helps attackers with social engineering messages
Can spread fake or misleading information

7. Risks and Limitations

Generative AI can be misused if not handled responsibly
The quality of output depends on the data it was trained on
It may generate incorrect or biased information

8. What I Learned from This Topic

This topic helped me understand how powerful Generative AI is and why cybersecurity professionals should be aware of its risks as well as its benefits.
